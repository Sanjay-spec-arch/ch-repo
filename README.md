Churn Analysis Project
Overview
This project predicts customer churn using a Decision Tree model, deployed as a web application with Flask. It allows users to input customer data and receive real-time churn predictions, helping businesses identify customers at risk of leaving.
Features

Machine Learning Model: Decision Tree classifier to predict customer churn
Web Interface: User-friendly interface built with Flask
Real-time Predictions: Instant churn probability calculations
Data Visualization: Visual representation of churn factors
Easy Deployment: Simple setup for local or cloud deployment

Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language
Flask: Web framework for the application
scikit-learn: Machine learning library for the Decision Tree model
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: Numerical computing
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend development
Bootstrap: Responsive design components

Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.7+
pip package manager

Setup

Clone the repository

bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/churn-analysis.git
cd churn-analysis

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies

bashpip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Running the Application

Start the Flask server

bashpython app.py

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000

Making Predictions

Enter customer data in the web form
Click "Predict" to see churn probability
Review the prediction results and contributing factors

Model Information

Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier
Features: Customer demographics, service usage, billing information
Target Variable: Churn (Yes/No)
Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Development and Retraining
Retraining the Model
To retrain the model with new data or different parameters:

Prepare your dataset (CSV format recommended)
Run the training script

bashpython model/train_model.py --data path/to/new_data.csv

The script will generate a new model file that automatically replaces the existing one

Future Improvements

Add more machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
Implement feature importance visualization
Create user authentication system
Add data upload functionality
Develop API endpoints for integration with other systems
